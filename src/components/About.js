        <p>
           Hello! I'm Zesan Rahim, a passionate Software Developer
           based out of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I love building a variety of 
           different projects ranging from web applications
           and interactive user interfaces to full stack projects as well
           as innovative software solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always excited to explore new technologies,
          experiment with creative ideas, and solve real-world problems 
          through coding and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently am a Computer Science student at Carleton University
          focused on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
          Outside of school, I like to immerse myself in extra-curriculars,
          video games, and exploring.
