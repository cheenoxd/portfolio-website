      <p>
        Hello! I'm Zesan Rahim, a passionate Software Developer
        based out of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I love building a variety of 
        different projects ranging from web applications
        and interactive user interfaces to full stack projects as well
        as innovative software solutions. I'm always excited to explore new technologies,
        experiment with creative ideas, and solve real-world problems 
        through coding and development.

        I am currently a Computer Science student at Carleton University
        focused on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
        Outside of school, I like to immerse myself in extra-curriculars,
        video games, and exploring.
